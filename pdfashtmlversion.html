        <h2>Chosen Theme: Economic Development and Financial Markets</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on exploring the theme of <strong>Economic Development and Financial Markets</strong>, with a focus on understanding the financial challenges faced by developing countries and how modern tools like blockchain and social media are influencing market dynamics.</p>
        
        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>How do comments by people on social media and online forums impact stock market fluctuations in developing countries?</strong>
                <p>We will examine how online opinions from social media or financial forums affect stock market changes within developing countries. We want to see how discussions relating to companies, products, or industries affect the financial decisions of investors. After analyzing these online talks, we will explore the power these shared opinions have on stock prices. While ordinary people don't move the market like Elon Musk, whose tweets can make Dogecoin’s value skyrocket, we will study how general online sentiments, from influential or ordinary users, impact financial markets. We will focus on platforms such as Twitter and niche financial forums.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How do factors like average income, inflation rates, and savings behavior of a developing country affect a family's ability to buy a mid-priced Yamaha violin, and what does that say about the financial accessibility of the product in emerging markets?</strong>
                <p>This research seeks to understand how economic factors such as average income, inflation rates, and saving behavior in developing countries affect a family's ability to afford a mid-priced Yamaha violin. By examining the data, we will look at how long the average household in countries like Brazil, India, or Turkey would need to save for the violin, highlighting the economic challenges these families face and the financial accessibility of such products in emerging markets.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How can blockchain financial services help people and small businesses in developing countries get loans?</strong>
                <p>Accessing loans from traditional banks is difficult for many people and small businesses in developing countries. Blockchain-based lending platforms are offering solutions by enabling individuals and small businesses to borrow money without the need for banks. This research explores how these platforms work and how they can help foster growth among the unbanked population and small businesses in developing countries.</p>
